### Featured Projects

#### [Insider Threat Detection & SOAR Automation in Azure](https://github.com/KUN-01997/azure-soar-automation)
This project simulates insider threat detection in Azure using Microsoft Sentinel. It includes Terraform-based deployment, custom KQL analytics rules, and Logic App SOAR playbooks. Incidents are automatically tagged and critical alerts trigger email responses, all mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

#### [MITRE ATT&CK–Driven Cloud Based Threat Detection Using Wazuh](https://github.com/parayapaincho/cloud-threat-hunt-aws)
The project leverages AWS EC2 instances—one acting as the Wazuh manager and another as the monitored endpoint running the Wazuh agent. Simulated attacks are executed using lightweight Atomic Red Team–style scripts, which trigger custom Wazuh detection rules mapped directly to specific MITRE techniques.

#### [Malware Analysis Lab – Static & Behavioral Threat Intelligence](https://github.com/parayapaincho/malware-analysis-lab)
This project is a self-contained malware analysis lab focused on performing real-world analysis of malicious samples using both static and dynamic techniques. It demonstrates how to extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), understand behavioral patterns, and map threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

#### [IOC Enrichment Pipeline](https://github.com/KUN-01997/ioc-enrichment-pipeline)
This project automates the enrichment of indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, domains, and hashes. The script queries public threat intelligence APIs (VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB) and formats the results into actionable reports, helping SOC analysts reduce triage time and make faster decisions.

#### [Azure Sentinel Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/KUN-01997/azure-sentinel-threat-detection)
This project sets up a simulated threat detection environment in Microsoft Sentinel using Terraform. It deploys a Log Analytics Workspace, custom analytic rules, and Python-based simulated attack logs. The goal is to detect suspicious Azure activities—like unauthorized VM modifications or role changes—without relying on built-in data connectors. All alerts are triggered using custom log injections, making this a self-contained and repeatable detection engineering lab.

#### [Automated Threat Detection and Alerting on AWS with GuardDuty and Terraform](https://github.com/KUN-01997/aws-guardduty-automation)
This project builds an automated threat detection and alerting pipeline using AWS GuardDuty, Lambda, SNS, and DynamoDB—all deployed with Terraform. When GuardDuty detects a suspicious event, a Lambda function checks if it's a duplicate using DynamoDB, and sends a real-time email alert through SNS. It’s a fully cloud-native setup designed to demonstrate practical skills in detection engineering, serverless automation, and infrastructure as code.

#### [Azure Defender for Cloud – Misconfiguration Detection & Terraform Remediation](https://github.com/KUN-01997/azure-defender-validation)
This project simulates and detects common Azure misconfigurations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It deploys both secure and intentionally vulnerable resources via Terraform, triggers Defender recommendations, and validates automated remediation workflows.
