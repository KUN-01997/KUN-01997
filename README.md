### 📁 Featured Projects

#### 🧠 [MITRE ATT&CK Threat Hunting Campaign](https://github.com/KUN-01997/mitre-threat-hunting-campaign)
This project is a hands-on threat hunting campaign built to proactively detect common adversary behaviors using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It includes real-world simulations using Atomic Red Team, custom detection queries, and visual dashboards developed within a Windows + Elastic Stack environment. The project simulates techniques such as PowerShell abuse, credential dumping, and system reconnaissance to build detection logic and triage processes.

#### ☁️ [Cloud Threat Detection Lab (AWS)](https://github.com/KUN-01997/aws-detection-lab)
This project demonstrates detection and response to simulated cloud-native threats in AWS. It involves configuring key monitoring tools like CloudTrail and GuardDuty, simulating common cloud attacks (e.g., IAM privilege abuse, S3 bucket exposure), and building alerting mechanisms using EventBridge, SNS, and Lambda. Dashboards visualize incident trends and trigger responses based on real-time telemetry.

#### 🤖 [IOC Enrichment Pipeline](https://github.com/KUN-01997/ioc-enrichment-pipeline)
This project automates the enrichment of indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, domains, and hashes. The script queries public threat intelligence APIs (VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB) and formats the results into actionable reports, helping SOC analysts reduce triage time and make faster decisions.
