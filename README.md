### Featured Projects

#### [MITRE ATT&CK‚ÄìDriven Cloud Based Threat Detection Using Wazuh](https://github.com/parayapaincho/cloud-threat-hunt-aws)
The project leverages AWS EC2 instances‚Äîone acting as the Wazuh manager and another as the monitored endpoint running the Wazuh agent. Simulated attacks are executed using lightweight Atomic Red Team‚Äìstyle scripts, which trigger custom Wazuh detection rules mapped directly to specific MITRE techniques.

#### [Malware Analysis Lab ‚Äì Static & Behavioral Threat Intelligence](https://github.com/parayapaincho/malware-analysis-lab)
This project demonstrates detection and response to simulated cloud-native threats in AWS. It involves configuring key monitoring tools like CloudTrail and GuardDuty, simulating common cloud attacks (e.g., IAM privilege abuse, S3 bucket exposure), and building alerting mechanisms using EventBridge, SNS, and Lambda. Dashboards visualize incident trends and trigger responses based on real-time telemetry.

#### [IOC Enrichment Pipeline](https://github.com/KUN-01997/ioc-enrichment-pipeline)
This project automates the enrichment of indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, domains, and hashes. The script queries public threat intelligence APIs (VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB) and formats the results into actionable reports, helping SOC analysts reduce triage time and make faster decisions.

#### [Azure Sentinel Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/KUN-01997/azure-sentinel-threat-detection)
This project sets up a simulated threat detection environment in Microsoft Sentinel using Terraform. It deploys a Log Analytics Workspace, custom analytic rules, and Python-based simulated attack logs. The goal is to detect suspicious Azure activities‚Äîlike unauthorized VM modifications or role changes‚Äîwithout relying on built-in data connectors. All alerts are triggered using custom log injections, making this a self-contained and repeatable detection engineering lab.

#### [Automated Threat Detection and Alerting on AWS with GuardDuty and Terraform](https://github.com/KUN-01997/aws-guardduty-automation)
This project builds an automated threat detection and alerting pipeline using AWS GuardDuty, Lambda, SNS, and DynamoDB‚Äîall deployed with Terraform. When GuardDuty detects a suspicious event, a Lambda function checks if it's a duplicate using DynamoDB, and sends a real-time email alert through SNS. It‚Äôs a fully cloud-native setup designed to demonstrate practical skills in detection engineering, serverless automation, and infrastructure as code.

#### [Azure Defender for Cloud ‚Äì Misconfiguration Detection & Terraform Remediation](https://github.com/KUN-01997/azure-defender-validation)
This project simulates and detects common Azure misconfigurations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It deploys both secure and intentionally vulnerable resources via Terraform, triggers Defender recommendations, and validates automated remediation workflows.
